1. **View Binding Setup**:
   The binding variable is declared as a lateinit property for View Binding. View Binding allows direct access to the views defined in the XML layout.
2. **Activity Initialization**:
   In the onCreate method, the layout is inflated using View Binding (binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)) and set as the content view.
3. **Button Click Listener**:
   A click listener is set for the color-changing Button (binding.colorBtn.setOnClickListener { changeColor() }).
4. **ChangeColor Function**:

- This function is called when the Button is clicked.
- It generates a random color using the generateRandomColor function.
- Constructs a string containing the RGB values of the generated color.
- Sets the text of the TextView (binding.colorTextView.text) to display the RGB values.
- Sets the text color of the TextView to the generated random color (binding.colorTextView.setTextColor(randomColor)).

5. **GenerateRandomColor Function**:

- Generates random values for the red, green, and blue components of a color (RGB) using the random() function.
- Creates and returns the color using the Color.rgb method.
  When the Button is clicked, it triggers a function that generates a random color, updates the TextView to display the RGB values of the color, and changes the text color of the TextView to the generated color.
