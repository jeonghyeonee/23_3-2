## Fragment Assignment

### Use Case

1. When the application is launched, no UI components should be in the main fragments area. Only a "Welcome…" message should appear in the sub-fragment.

2. If a user touches the "Add new member" button, the fragment to input personal information should be loaded and displayed in the middle area.

3. After filling in the forms, the user will touch the "Next" button. Another fragment to input address information should be loaded and displayed in the middle area. The user’s information (name, age, and student number) should be passed to the Activity.

4. After filling in the forms, the user will touch the "Done!" button. The fragment at the bottom should display a "Registration Confirmed!" message with the user’s name, "Please review your data!" text in red, and the user’s student ID, age, and City data. The user’s information (city, postal code, and address) should be passed to the Activity. The activity then passes student information to the sub-fragment, which displays the information.

#### Notes

- Implement data transfer from fragments to activity using interfaces.
- No restrictions on data transfer from activity to fragment.
- Determine how to store user data. You can use a data class to define student information.

## Code Analysis

### 1. MainActivity Initialization:

- **ViewBinding:**

  - The MainActivity initializes ViewBinding to access views in the layout.

- **Button Click Listener:**

  - Sets a click listener on the "Add Member" button.
  - When clicked, it replaces the fragment in middleFragmentContainer with a new PersonalInfoFragment.
  - Utilizes FragmentManager and FragmentTransaction for the transaction.

- **Load Saved Data:**

  - Loads saved data (if available) for studentInfo and addressInfo from SharedPreferences.

- **Show Welcome Fragment:**
  - Initializes the UI by showing the WelcomeFragment in bottomFragmentContainer by default.

### 2. Data Transfer from PersonalInfoFragment:

- **Next Button Click:**

  - When the "Next" button in PersonalInfoFragment is clicked, it gathers the entered data (name, age, student number).
  - Creates a StudentInfo object.

- **Data Transfer to MainActivity:**

  - Calls the onPersonalInfoDataTransfer method in MainActivity.
  - Saves the transferred data to SharedPreferences, updates local data (studentInfo), and shows the WelcomeFragment.

- **Fragment Transaction:**
  - Replaces PersonalInfoFragment in middleFragmentContainer with AddressInfoFragment.

### 3. Data Transfer from AddressInfoFragment:

- **Done Button Click:**

  - When the "Done" button in AddressInfoFragment is clicked, it gathers the entered address data.
  - Creates an AddressInfo object.

- **Data Transfer to MainActivity:**

  - Calls the onAddressInfoDataTransfer method in MainActivity.
  - Saves the transferred data to SharedPreferences, updates local data (addressInfo), and shows the ResultFragment.

- **Fragment Transaction:**
  - Replaces the current fragment in bottomFragmentContainer with ResultFragment.

### 4. ResultFragment Display:

- **Fragment Initialization:**

  - Initializes ResultFragment and sets up View Binding.

- **Data Retrieval:**

  - Retrieves data (name, age, city, student number) from MainActivity using the OnDataTransferListener interface.

- **Display Data:**
  - Displays the retrieved information in the corresponding TextViews.

### 5. WelcomeFragment Display:

- **Fragment Initialization:**
  - Initializes WelcomeFragment and sets up View Binding.

### 6. Additional Points:

- **BackStack:**

  - Fragments are added to the back stack to enable back navigation.

- **Interface (OnDataTransferListener):**
  - Provides a way for fragments to communicate with the activity.

This process ensures that data is transferred between fragments and MainActivity appropriately, and the UI is updated accordingly through fragment transactions.
